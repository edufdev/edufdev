#### About me ðŸ¤”
I am a backend web developer with Python and Django. I study systems engineering at the University Mariano Galvez in Guatemala, I also study at Platzi, in their school of programming and software development. I am passionate about artificial intelligence, data science and especially process automation. I am looking for a company where I can apply all my technical knowledge and soft skills to grow the digital economy of our region.

#### Languages
I am from Guatemala, my native language is Spanish. As I advanced in my professional career I had to learn English to become a professional backend developer. Being Guatemala very visited by tourists I learned the basics to understand and communicate ideas in Portuguese and Italian. My roots in the country allowed me to learn the basics of Cachiquel, one of the 22 Mayan languages spoken in Guatemala.

> -- C++: |
> -- Other: |

#####  1. Python:

learned to program from scratch with the fastest growing language on the planet: Python. I discovered what an algorithm is and how to build one. I mastered variables, functions, data structures, conditionals, loops and projects:

> 1. Create data structures |
> 2. Create loops |
> 3. I learned programming tools |
> 4. I learned basic Python concepts |

##### Programs developed with Python:
###### Basics
> - Calculator |
> - Guessing game |
> - Dictionaries |
> - Multiplication tables |
> - Password generator |
> - Loops |
> - Currency converters |
> - Conditionals |
> - Functions |
> - Palindrome |
> - Primality test |
> - Path |

###### Intermediate
> - I am still working on them, I will show them to you very soon.  ðŸš€ðŸ’¯ |

###### Advanced
> - I am still working on them, I will show them to you very soon. ðŸ’¯ðŸ’» |

##### 2. University projects using C++

Programs made within the university career of Systems Engineering. These programs were made using C++, applying logic, use of simple algorithms, functions, among other things. It also includes the final projects of the course.

###### Some of the programs implemented:

> * Sales menu |
> * Switch case |
> * Fgets - Fputs |
> * Average of degrees |
> * Cycle up |
> * Descending Cisco |
